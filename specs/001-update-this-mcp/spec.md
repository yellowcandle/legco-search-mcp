# Feature Specification: Update MCP Server to Latest Version

**Feature Branch**: `001-update-this-mcp`
**Created**: 2025-01-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "update this mcp server to the latest version"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer maintaining the LegCo Search MCP Server, I want to update the server to the latest version so that it remains compatible with current MCP protocol standards and benefits from the latest improvements and security updates.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the current MCP server is running on an older version, **When** I deploy the updated version, **Then** the server maintains all existing functionality while supporting any new protocol features
2. **Given** users are connected to the MCP server, **When** the server is updated, **Then** existing client connections continue to work without interruption
3. **Given** the update process is initiated, **When** the update completes successfully, **Then** all health checks pass and the server responds to MCP protocol messages

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the latest version introduces breaking changes to the MCP protocol?
- How does the system handle version compatibility between server and clients during the update?
- What happens if the update process fails midway through deployment?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST identify the current MCP protocol version being used
- **FR-002**: System MUST determine what constitutes the "latest version" [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: latest MCP protocol version, latest dependencies, or both?]
- **FR-003**: System MUST verify compatibility between current and target versions
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a migration path for any breaking changes
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing MCP clients during transition period
- **FR-006**: System MUST update all MCP protocol implementations to match latest specification
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate that all existing functionality continues to work after update
- **FR-008**: System MUST update security implementations to address any new security requirements in latest version

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-009**: System MUST update dependencies to latest versions [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which dependencies - MCP-related only, or all dependencies? Risk assessment needed]
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain performance benchmarks after update [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what are the current performance benchmarks to maintain?]
