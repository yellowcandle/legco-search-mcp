# Data Model: Update MCP Server to Latest Version

## Overview
This feature focuses on updating the MCP server implementation to support the latest protocol version while maintaining backward compatibility and performance standards. The data model centers around version management, compatibility tracking, and performance monitoring.

## Core Entities

### MCPVersion
Represents the MCP protocol version information and compatibility status.

**Fields:**
- `protocolVersion` (string): The MCP protocol version identifier (e.g., "2024-11-05", "2025-06-18")
- `isCurrent` (boolean): Whether this is the currently implemented version
- `isLatest` (boolean): Whether this is the latest available version
- `releaseDate` (string): ISO date when this version was released
- `breakingChanges` (array): List of breaking changes introduced in this version
- `newFeatures` (array): List of new features introduced in this version

**Validation Rules:**
- `protocolVersion` must match YYYY-MM-DD format
- `releaseDate` must be valid ISO date string
- Arrays cannot be null but can be empty

**Relationships:**
- One-to-many with `ClientCompatibility`

### ServerConfiguration
Represents the current server configuration and update status.

**Fields:**
- `currentVersion` (string): Currently deployed MCP protocol version
- `targetVersion` (string): Version to update to (if update in progress)
- `updateStatus` (enum): "stable", "updating", "rollback", "failed"
- `lastUpdateAttempt` (string): ISO timestamp of last update attempt
- `rollbackVersion` (string): Version to rollback to if needed
- `healthCheckEnabled` (boolean): Whether health checks are operational

**Validation Rules:**
- `updateStatus` must be one of: "stable", "updating", "rollback", "failed"
- `lastUpdateAttempt` must be valid ISO timestamp when present
- `currentVersion` and `targetVersion` must be valid protocol versions

**Relationships:**
- References `MCPVersion` for current and target versions

### ClientCompatibility
Tracks compatibility between server versions and MCP clients.

**Fields:**
- `clientType` (string): Type of MCP client (e.g., "claude-desktop", "custom-client")
- `clientVersion` (string): Version of the client
- `supportedProtocolVersions` (array): Array of supported MCP protocol versions
- `lastTested` (string): ISO timestamp when compatibility was last tested
- `compatibilityStatus` (enum): "compatible", "incompatible", "unknown", "deprecated"

**Validation Rules:**
- `clientType` cannot be empty
- `supportedProtocolVersions` must contain at least one version
- `compatibilityStatus` must be one of defined enum values
- `lastTested` must be valid ISO timestamp

**Relationships:**
- References `MCPVersion` for supported versions

### PerformanceMetrics
Tracks performance benchmarks and health status.

**Fields:**
- `timestamp` (string): ISO timestamp when metrics were recorded
- `healthCheckResponseTime` (number): Response time in milliseconds for health checks
- `apiTimeoutCount` (number): Number of API timeouts in the measurement period
- `averageLatency` (number): Average response latency in milliseconds
- `errorRate` (number): Error rate as percentage (0-100)
- `activeConnections` (number): Number of active connections

**Validation Rules:**
- `healthCheckResponseTime` must be >= 0
- `apiTimeoutCount` must be >= 0
- `averageLatency` must be >= 0
- `errorRate` must be between 0 and 100
- `activeConnections` must be >= 0
- `timestamp` must be valid ISO timestamp

**Relationships:**
- Independent entity for monitoring and alerting

## Data Flow

### Version Update Process
1. `MCPVersion` entity identifies available versions
2. `ServerConfiguration` tracks update progress
3. `ClientCompatibility` ensures client support
4. `PerformanceMetrics` validates post-update performance

### Compatibility Checking
1. Client connects with version information
2. `ClientCompatibility` lookup determines support
3. `MCPVersion` provides feature availability
4. `ServerConfiguration` may restrict access during updates

### Performance Monitoring
1. Health checks record `PerformanceMetrics`
2. API calls update timeout and latency data
3. Error rates trigger alerts
4. Historical data supports rollback decisions

## State Transitions

### Server Update States
- **stable**: Normal operation, current version stable
- **updating**: Version update in progress, limited functionality
- **rollback**: Rolling back to previous version
- **failed**: Update failed, manual intervention required

### Client Compatibility States
- **compatible**: Client works with current server version
- **incompatible**: Client cannot connect or use features
- **unknown**: Compatibility not yet tested
- **deprecated**: Client version no longer supported

## Validation Constraints

### Business Rules
- Server cannot update to incompatible version without client migration plan
- Performance metrics must stay within constitutional limits (<100ms health checks, 60s timeouts)
- Failed updates must have rollback capability
- Client compatibility must be tested before full deployment

### Data Integrity
- All version strings must follow semantic versioning or date-based format
- Timestamps must be consistent across all entities
- Arrays cannot contain null values
- Enum values must match defined constants
