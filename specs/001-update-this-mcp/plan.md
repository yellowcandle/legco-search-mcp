# Implementation Plan: Update MCP Server to Latest Version

**Branch**: `001-update-this-mcp` | **Date**: 2025-01-15 | **Spec**: /specs/001-update-this-mcp/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from /specs/001-update-this-mcp/spec.md

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Successfully migrated the LegCo Search MCP Server from direct MCP protocol implementation (2024-11-05) to Cloudflare's official Agents SDK with MCP 2025-06-18. The modernization leverages the McpAgent class for improved state management, built-in OAuth support, automatic scaling with Durable Objects, and better integration with Cloudflare platform features while maintaining all existing MCP functionality and performance standards.

**Migration Results**:
- ✅ Protocol upgraded to 2025-06-18 with new features (resource subscriptions, annotations, progress notifications, ping support)

**Structure Decision**: [DEFAULT to Option 1 unless Technical Context indicates web/mobile app]

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Research Agents SDK migration requirements**:
    - Analyze current direct MCP implementation vs McpAgent class
    - Identify state management migration path (custom → built-in SQL)
    - Evaluate OAuth integration requirements
    - Assess transport layer changes (current → Agents SDK transports)

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
    ```
    Task: "Research Cloudflare Agents SDK McpAgent class capabilities"
    Task: "Analyze migration from direct MCP to Agents SDK"
    Task: "Evaluate OAuth integration with Workers OAuth Provider"
    Task: "Assess Durable Objects state management for MCP server"
    Task: "Research transport layer compatibility (SSE/WebSocket)"
    ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
    - Decision: [migration approach chosen]
    - Rationale: [why Agents SDK migration provides better platform integration]
    - Alternatives considered: [continue direct implementation vs full migration]
    - Breaking changes: [identify any required API changes]
    - Performance impact: [expected improvements from Durable Objects]

**Output**: research.md with complete migration strategy and risk assessment

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Design McpAgent migration** → `data-model.md`:
    - Map current state management to Agents SDK SQL database
    - Define agent instance lifecycle and state transitions
    - Design OAuth integration with user permissions
    - Model MCP tool state persistence and session management

2. **Update API contracts** for Agents SDK compatibility:
    - Migrate existing MCP contracts to work with McpAgent.serve() and .serveSSE()
    - Add OAuth endpoints for authentication flow
    - Update transport contracts for both SSE and Streamable HTTP
    - Maintain backward compatibility with existing MCP clients

3. **Generate contract tests** for new architecture:
    - Test McpAgent initialization and state management
    - Validate OAuth authentication flow
    - Test transport compatibility (SSE/WebSocket)
    - Ensure MCP tool functionality preservation

4. **Extract test scenarios** for migration validation:
    - Agent lifecycle and state persistence tests
    - OAuth authentication and authorization tests
    - Transport compatibility and performance tests
    - MCP protocol compliance across all tools

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
    - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh opencode` for your AI assistant
    - Add Agents SDK capabilities and McpAgent usage
    - Update technical context with Durable Objects and OAuth
    - Preserve manual additions between markers
    - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
    - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each McpAgent migration component → implementation task [P]
- OAuth integration → authentication setup tasks
- State management migration → database schema tasks [P]
- Transport layer updates → compatibility tasks
- MCP tool preservation → refactoring tasks [P]
- Testing and validation → comprehensive test suite tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Foundation first: Set up Agents SDK and basic McpAgent structure
- Infrastructure: OAuth authentication and Durable Objects configuration
- Migration: State management and MCP tool refactoring
- Integration: Transport compatibility and API contract updates
- Validation: Comprehensive testing and performance verification
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent tool migrations, contract tests)

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md focusing on:
1. Agents SDK setup and McpAgent foundation (4-5 tasks)
2. OAuth authentication integration (3-4 tasks)
3. State management migration (3-4 tasks)
4. MCP tool refactoring and transport updates (5-6 tasks)
5. Testing, validation, and deployment (5-6 tasks)

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan
